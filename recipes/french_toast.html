            <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>

        <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat griddle to 350 degrees F or or heat a skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>In a blender, add the eggs, milk, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla. Blend until smooth. If you prefer whisking by hand, start by mixing the flour and eggs together in a shallow dish, then whisk in the rest of the ingredients until combined.</li>
            <li>Dip bread slices into the batter, dredging them well on both sides, and place on hot, greased griddle or skillet.</li>
            <li>Cook for a few minutes, until the bottom of the breads starts to get golden brown. Flip and cook on the other side the same.</li>
            <li>Remove to a plate. Serve warm with syrup and a sprinkle of powdered sugar.</li>
        </ol>
